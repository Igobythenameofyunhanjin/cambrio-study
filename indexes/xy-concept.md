# X, Y Concept in sigmaNEST
## Meaning
- To define cutting path (position & movement)

## Axises
- X-axis: Horizontal direction on the sheet (left to right)
- Y-axis: Vertical direction on the sheet (bottom to top)
- Example: (X: 100, Y:50) is 100mm to right, 50mm to top 

## Routing the cutting path
- sigmaNEST calculates X and Y coordinates for nesting and cutting path.
